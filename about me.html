<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<h5><p>Little bit about me, I am Rivo Kaseorg and I live in Estonia.<br />
    At the moment I work as a scaffolder in Finland and have been doing this job about 11 years now.<br />
    Coding and web development has been something that I have always been interested in and I am very excited to learn and try different codes and solutions and programming languages on my way to become a web developer.
